# parquet-vs-csv
A very simple comparison of reading a csv vs parquet file. First, you need to generate a csv file and save it to the parquet file. The csv file should be about 1GB with the parquet file being about 400MB. To generate and save csv and parquet file, run the `create_csv_file.py` function. Next, use `test_read_data.r` for R and `test_read_data.py` for Python language.
